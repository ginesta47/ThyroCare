# ThyroCare: AI-Powered Thyroid Disease Management

Final project for the Building AI course.

## Summary

ThyroCare is an AI-driven mobile application designed to support patients with thyroid disorders (hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, thyroid cancer, goiter, and thyroiditis). 

The app provides:

✅ Early symptom screening using an AI questionnaire.
✅ Personalized treatment tracking (medication reminders, lab result storage).
✅ Patient community for shared experiences.
✅ Verified medical information from trusted sources.

Goal: To reduce diagnostic delays and improve treatment adherence through accessible technology.

## Background

The Problem:

* Thyroid diseases affect ~10% of the global population (WHO), yet many cases go undiagnosed for years due to vague symptoms (fatigue, weight changes).
* Patients often struggle with lifelong medication management and lack reliable resources.

Why It Matters:

* Untreated thyroid disorders can lead to severe complications (heart disease, infertility, etc.).
* ThyroCare bridges the gap between doctor visits by offering continuous support.

## How is it used?

For Undiagnosed Users:

1. Complete a symptom-based AI questionnaire.
2. Receive a risk assessment (e.g., "High likelihood of hypothyroidism").
3. Get guided to consult an endocrinologist.

For Diagnosed Patients:

* Log medications, lab results, and symptoms.
* Join peer-support groups.
* Access curated educational content.

Data Sources & AI Methods:

Data: 

* Medical guidelines: American Thyroid Association, PubMed studies.
* User-reported data: Anonymized symptoms/treatment logs.
* Community discussions: NLP-processed forum posts.

AI Techniques:

* Classification models (Random Forest, SVM) for symptom screening.
* NLP to analyze patient experiences and detect trends.
* Recommender systems for personalized resources.

## Challenges

⚠️ Not a diagnostic tool: Always requires physician confirmation.
⚠️ Data bias: Needs diverse clinical validation.
⚠️ Privacy: Strict compliance with HIPAA/GDPR for health data.

## What next?

* Wearable integration: Sync with Apple Watch/Fitbit for heart rate/activity data.
* Telemedicine partnerships: Connect users with endocrinologists.
* Multilingual support: Expand accessibility globally.

## Acknowledgments

* Open-source tools: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Hugging Face. 
* Inspiration: Apps like MyTherapy and PatientsLikeMe.
* University of Helsinki’s Building AI Course for foundational knowledge.
